The association of statin therapy with reduced intracranial aneurysm recurrence after endovascular coiling: a post hoc propensity score-matched analysis of a randomized clinical trial.,"Endovascular intracranial aneurysm (IA) management has significantly evolved over the last 2 decades. Despite these advancements, the aneurysm recanalization rate after coil embolization remains a concern. Statins have been found to affect vascular repair and remodeling; therefore, the authors hypothesized that patients receiving statin therapy at the time of coil embolization would have lower aneurysm recurrence and retreatment rates compared with patients not receiving statin therapy.",Journal of neurosurgery,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39705700
Natural history of dolichoectatic vertebrobasilar aneurysms: a multinational study.,"Dolichoectatic vertebrobasilar aneurysms (DVBAs) are expansions of arterial tissue leading to aneurysmal formations without an obvious neck. Their natural history is poorly understood; usually patients are admitted with thromboembolic complications and/or neurological symptoms from the mass effect. There have not been international collective data, and correct timing for highly risky treatments has been under discussion. The goal of this study was to define the natural history of DVBA by long-term follow-up in an international population of patients with DVBA.",Journal of neurosurgery,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39705689
Effect of IV Thrombolysis With Alteplase in Patients With Vessel Occlusion in the WAKE-UP Trial.,"Data from randomized trials on the treatment effect of pure thrombolysis in patients with vessel occlusion are lacking. We examined data from a corresponding subsample of patients from the multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled WAKE-UP trial to determine whether MRI-guided IV thrombolysis with alteplase in unknown-onset ischemic stroke benefits patients presenting with vessel occlusion.",Neurology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39705631
The effectiveness of optic nerve sheath diameter in predicting large vessel occlusion in ischemic stroke patients.,This study assessed the effectiveness of ultrasonography-measured optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) in predicting large vessel occlusion (LVO) in ischemic stroke patients.,Medical ultrasonography,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39705627
Cerebral Hemodynamic Responses to Disease-Modifying and Curative Sickle Cell Disease Therapies.,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hemoglobinopathy resulting in hemoglobin-S production, hemolytic anemia, and elevated stroke risk. Treatments include oral hydroxyurea, blood transfusions, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Our objective was to evaluate the neurologic relevance of these therapies by characterizing how treatment-induced changes in hemoglobin (Hb) affect brain health biomarkers.",Neurology,2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39705613
"Power Strokes in Molecular Motors: Predictive, Irrelevant, or Somewhere in Between?","For several decades, molecular motor directionality has been rationalized in terms of the free energy of molecular conformations visited before and after the motor takes a step, a so-called power stroke mechanism with analogues in macroscopic engines. Despite theoretical and experimental demonstrations of its flaws, the power stroke language is quite ingrained, and some communities still value power stroke intuition. By building a catalysis-driven motor into simulated numerical experiments, we here systematically report on how directionality responds when the motor is modified accordingly to power stroke intuition. We confirm that the power stroke mechanism generally does not predict motor directionality. Nevertheless, the simulations illustrate that the relative stability of molecular conformations should be included as a potential design element to adjust the motor directional bias. Though power strokes are formally unimportant for determining directionality, we show that practical attempts to alter a power stroke have side effects that can in fact alter the bias. The change in the bias can align with what power stroke intuition would have suggested, offering a potential explanation for why the flawed power stroke mechanism can retain apparent utility when engineering specific systems.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39705514
The adverse effect of mood swings on the risk of cardiovascular diseases: Evidence from Mendelian randomization analysis.,"Recent studies have explored the impact of personality traits, including mood swings, on physical health. However, it remains unclear whether there is a direct cause-and-effect link between mood swings and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). A STROBE-compliant cross-sectional observational study was conducted and analyzed using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to examine the potential causal relationship between mood swings and a range of CVDs, such as arrhythmia, artery aneurysm, coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure, hypertension, stroke, ischemic stroke, and peripheral artery disease. We sourced genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data for mood swings from the UK Biobank, and for CVDs from the GWAS Catalog and FinnGen databases. We excluded single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to potential confounders such as obesity, smoking, sex, diabetes, as well as SNPs suspected of horizontal pleiotropy, as identified by MR-PRESSO and the MR-pleiotropy method, prior to the final analysis. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using the MR-Egger, inverse variance weighted, and leave-one-out methods. After screening, 57 SNPs were identified as instrumental variables for mood swings, and 9 SNPs related to confounding factors were excluded. An increase in mood swing frequency is correlated with a significant increase in the likelihood of various conditions. Notably, arrhythmia in the FinnGen dataset showed an odds ratio (OR: 2.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.44-3.61, P < .001), and atrial fibrillation had an OR (OR: 2.25, 95% CI: 1.23-4.11, P = .01). CHD risk was elevated in both the IEU OpenGWAS project (OR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.30-3.21, P < .001) and GWAS Catalog (OR: 4.45, 95% CI: 1.75-11.33, P < .001). Increased risks were also noted for heart failure (GWAS Catalog: OR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.09-2.83, P = .02) and hypertension (FinnGen: OR, 2.17; 95% CI: 1.47-3.19, P < .001). However, no significant associations were found for conditions such as arterial aneurysms or ischemic stroke. In combined analyses, mood swings were associated with a higher risk of CHD (OR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.64-2.97, P < .01), heart failure (OR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.21-2.50, P < .01), and other CVDs. This study revealed a causal link between mood swings and various CVDs, highlighting intriguing findings. This suggests that implementing proper psychological interventions to stabilize mood may be beneficial for preventing negative cardiovascular events.",Medicine,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39705472
Bilateral thalamic infarction with posterior cerebral artery variant (the arcade artery): A case report.,"Bilateral thalamic infarction is a rare type of posterior circulation stroke, and it often presents with a reduced level of consciousness in the elderly. Arteriosclerosis is the primary etiology of bilateral thalamic infarction, including conditions such as native vessel stenosis or arterial-to-arterial embolism. Cardiogenic or paradoxical embolism can also lead to thrombosis of the perforator branches innervating the thalamus, and these emboli tend to disintegrate and lead to multiple lesions, even in elderly patients.",Medicine,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39705463
Nonstenotic carotid artery plaques on computed tomography angiography in embolic stroke of undetermined source.,"This study aims to evaluate the role of <50% stenotic cervical carotid artery plaques in embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS), focusing on plaque characteristics in symptomatic versus asymptomatic carotid arteries (contralateral). In this cross-sectional observational study, 81 patients who met the diagnostic criteria for ESUS and underwent were retrospectively analyzed. Carotid plaques causing <50% stenosis were examined, noting features such as plaque thickness, degree of luminal stenosis, irregularity, ulceration, calcification, and hypodensity. These characteristics were compared between the ipsilateral and contralateral carotid arteries. The study involved 33 men and 48 women, with plaques ≥3mm thick significantly more common in the ipsilateral carotid arteries (P < .05). Notable features such as plaque ulceration, irregularity, noncalcified plaque, and hypodensity were significantly more frequent ipsilaterally (P < .05). Of the plaque patients, 54.3% (44/81) were on the ipsilateral side, compared to 29.6% (24/81) on the contralateral side (P = .0024). Our findings underscore the potential significance of non-stenotic carotid plaques in ESUS. These plaques, especially those with certain high-risk characteristics, are more prevalent ipsilaterally and should be considered in clinical evaluations and treatment of ESUS.",Medicine,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39705450
Pathological roles of mitochondrial dysfunction in endothelial cells during the cerebral no-reflow phenomenon: A review.,"Emergency intravascular interventional therapy is the most effective approach to rapidly restore blood flow and manage occlusion of major blood vessels during the initial phase of acute ischemic stroke. Nevertheless, several patients continue to experience ineffective reperfusion or cerebral no-reflow phenomenon, that is, hypoperfusion of cerebral blood supply after treatment. This is primarily attributed to downstream microcirculation disturbance. As integral components of the cerebral microvascular structure, endothelial cells (ECs) attach importance to regulating microcirculatory blood flow. Unlike neurons and microglia, ECs harbor a relatively low abundance of mitochondria, acting as key sensors of environmental and cellular stress in regulating the viability, structural integrity, and function of ECs rather than generating energy. Mitochondria dysfunction including increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species levels and disturbed mitochondrial dynamics causes endothelial injury, further causing microcirculation disturbance involved in the cerebral no-reflow phenomenon. Therefore, this review aims to discuss the role of mitochondrial changes in regulating the role of ECs and cerebral microcirculation blood flow during I/R injury. The outcomes of the review will provide promising potential therapeutic targets for future prevention and effective improvement of the cerebral no-reflow phenomenon.",Medicine,2024,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39705421
