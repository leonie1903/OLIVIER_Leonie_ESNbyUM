profiling immune cellrelated gene features and immunoregulatory cerna in ischemic stroke,mol biomed,2024 dec 18,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39690389,molecules in immune cells plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke is the aim of this study is to profile the landscape of molecules on the basis of immune cells in is peripheral blood and construct an immunoregulatory competing endogenous rna cerna network we collected and combined multiple public transcriptome datasets from the peripheral blood of is patients and healthy controls cibersort deconvolution revealed that the proportions of cd8 and cd4 naive t cells monocytes and neutrophils changed significantly in the is group intersecting the immune cellrelated genes identified by weighted gene coexpression network analysis wgcna and differential expression analysis 38 overlapping candidate biomarkers were selected three machine learning algorithms including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso support vector machinerecursive feature elimination svmrfe and random forest were applied and 11 distinct immune cellrelated genes were identified we obtained the mrnamirna and mirnalncrna interactions from starbase v30 and constructed a cerna network based on the differentially expressed mrnas mirnas and lncrnas the aberrant expression of hecw2centered cernas in the peripheral blood of inhouse patients was validated using quantitative pcr we also revealed that the expression of hecw2 was positively correlated with lncrnas linc02593 through mirnas mir130a3p mir130b3p and mir148b3p in cells these results show that there are distinct immune features between is patients and healthy controls the cerna network may help elucidate the mechanism of immune cellrelated genes in is and may serve as a therapeutic target
association between handgrip strength and mortality risk among cardiovascular disease patients a cohort study from the nhanes 20112014,j formos med assoc,2024 dec 16,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39690049,background cardiovascular disease cvd and handgrip strength hgs are recognized mortality risk factors however the synergistic effect of cvd and hgs on mortality remains unclear this study investigated the relationship between hgs and mortality in cvd patients methods data from the national health and nutrition examination survey 20112014 were analyzed weighted cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic splines rcs were used to examine associations with subgroup sensitivity and predictive performance analyses results among 8262 adults 5056 female 851 with cvd 695 deaths 674 occurred over a median followup of 80 months compared to noncvd individuals with highhgs cvd patients with lowhgs had the highest risk of allcause mortality hazard ratio hr 876 95 ci 4201830 and cvd mortality hr 483 95 ci 348670 while cvd patients with highhgs showed no significant mortality risk increase among cvd patients the hrs for allcause and cvd mortality in the lowhgs group were 360 95 ci 221586 and 401 95 ci 168959 rcs analyses revealed that the relationships were linear pnonlinear 005 and subgroup analyses revealed stroke status potentially modified the association for cvd mortality pinteraction 0002 the addition of hgs significantly improved the predictive performance of current models for mortality p 0001 conclusion low hgs may be associated with a higher risk of allcause and cvd mortality among cvd patients high hgs appears to reduce mortality risk among cvd patients these findings suggest that hgs may serve as a valuable predictor of mortality risk in cvd patients

physics of sliding on water explains morphological and behavioural allometry across a wide range of body sizes in water striders gerridae,proc biol sci,2024 dec,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39689886,laws of physics shape adaptations to locomotion and semiaquatic habitats of water striders provide opportunities to explore adaptations to locomotion on water surface the hydrodynamics of typical propelling with symmetrical strokes of midlegs is well understood but the subsequent passive sliding on surface has not been explored we hypothesized that morphological and behavioural adaptations to sliding vary by body size based on empirical observations of water striders across a wide range of body size we constructed a theoretical model of floating and resistance during sliding our model predicts that large water striders are too heavy to support anterior body on forelegs during sliding when their two midlegs are off the surface symmetrically during a recovery phase after stroke in symmetric gait heavy species should either i develop sufficiently long forelegs to support their anterior body on surface during symmetric gait or ii use asymmetric gait when one forwardextended midleg supports anterior body observations were consistent with these predictions additionally mediumsized insects were observed to switch between symmetrical and asymmetrical gait in the manner that reduces sliding resistance our results illustrate how habitatspecific physical processes cause morphological and behavioural diversity associated with body size among biological organisms
